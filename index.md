### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-01-chris-vasquez-2/tree/main/part-1)

    I liked Lab 1 because it taught me the fundamentals of GitHub and it was my first time working with others to solve a problem. Although it was hard at first, it helped me understand how to clone, push, and use GitHub effectively. I honestly thought this lab was a great stepping stone for me to step out of my comfort zone in regards to using a new tool and working with others!

* [Lab 4 (Part 2)](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-04-sam_ashley/tree/main/part-2)

    I thought Lab 4 Part 2 was the most fun that I had completing a lab, since I enjoy playing games creating a small interactive game made coding feel fun and relatable to my own personal interests. Designing the hi-lo guessing game helped me think more logically about user input and branching logic, since I struggled a little with the if statements but I eventually figured it out! It was satisfying to see a program I built actually interact like a real game, and it made me excited about how coding can create fun games! 

* [Lab 6 (Part 1)](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-06-sam-joy/tree/main/part-1)

    This was also a lab that I had interests in since it taught me a new way of reading and validating command line input without using pointers, where I am used to the generic pointer to the commands in the terminal. I didn't know there was a simplier approach to reading from the command line without the need to use arrays and pointers. I also thought, the sandwich prompt made it more engaging and fun since we would describe through the terminal if something was a sandwich was fun and interesting way of testing this lab!
