### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-01-chris-vasquez-2/tree/main/part-1)

    I liked Lab 1 because it taught me the fundamentals of GitHub and it was my first time working with others to solve a problem. Although it was hard at first, it helped me understand how to clone, push, and use GitHub effectively. It was a fun and rewarding challenge.

* [Lab 4 (Part 2)](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-04-sam_ashley/tree/main/part-2)

    I liked Lab 4 Part 2 because creating a small interactive game made coding feel fun and creative. Designing the hi-lo guessing game helped me think more logically about user input and branching logic. It was satisfying to see a program I built actually interact like a real game, and it made me excited about how coding can create fun, dynamic experiences.

* [Lab 6 (Part 1)](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-06-sam-joy/tree/main/part-1)

    I liked Lab 6 Part 1 because it taught me a new way of reading and validating command line input without using pointers. It felt cool to see how you can work with arguments in a safer, more structured way. Plus, the sandwich prompt made it more engaging and fun â€” who doesn't like the idea of making a sandwich?
