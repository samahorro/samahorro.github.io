### CPSC 120


# [**Lab 1**](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-01-chris-vasquez-2/tree/main/part-1)

I liked Lab 1 because it taught me the fundamentals of GitHub, and it was my first time working with others to solve a problem. Although it was hard at first, it helped me understand how to clone, push, and use GitHub effectively. It was a fun and rewarding challenge.

# [**Lab 6 Part 1**](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-06-sam-joy/tree/main/part-1)

I really enjoyed Lab 6 Part 1 because it introduced me to a different way of reading command-line input using `command_line.size()` instead of pointers. This approach felt more structured and easier to understand. I also appreciated the sandwich prompt â€” it made the lab more creative and fun!

# [**Lab 4 Part 2**](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-04-sam_ashley/tree/main/part-2)

I liked Lab 4 Part 2 because I enjoy games, and building a small interactive guessing game made programming feel more exciting and hands-on. It challenged me to think logically, design my own structure, and work through trial and error. Overall, it made learning C++ much more engaging and rewarding.
