### CPSC 120


* Lab 1
    > I liked Lab 1 because it taught me the fundamentals of GitHub and it was my first time working with others to solve a problem. 
    >Although it was hard at first, it helped me understand how to clone, push, and use GitHub effectively. 
    >It was a fun and rewarding challenge.

* Lab 4
    > I really enjoyed Lab 4 because it involved converting numbers, which I found both challenging and rewarding. 
    >It pushed me and my group mates to think critically, especially as I worked on code tracing and drawing diagrams to better understand the issues we encountered. 
    >It was a great exercise in problem-solving and collaboration.

* Lab 9
    > I liked Lab 9 because it taught me about Makefiles, something I had never used before. 
    >It gave me a strong fundamental understanding of how to automate compiling and testing programs. 
    >I found it really fun because of how easy it made compiling and running test cases!
